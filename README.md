## Description

This app is a content management system (CMS) made in order for employers (non-developers) to be able to easily view and interact with a database containing information about their employees.

Navigating through a relational (SQL) database requires a person to know how to operate a relational database management system, and most persons do not know how to do this. It requires knowledge of a certain language that is used to create, read, update, and delete information from a database. Rather than putting the acquisition of this knowledge on the shoulders of non-developers, an app like this allows an employer to simply navigate through menus that will ask the employer what they would like to do, and execute the desired operation for the employer.

The only technical knowledge required of the employer, then, is the ability to use their keyboard to navigate through lists, type responses, and press enter!

Through the development of this app, I practiced and learned the following technologies and skills:

### Technologies

- MySQL (relational database management)
- Node.js
- npm
- inquirer (npm package)
- mysql2 (npm package) (promise-based version)

### Skills

- Modularization
- Separation of concerns
- OOP/ Class-based JavaScript
- Async/await functions (asynchronicity)
- Creation of schema and seed files for MySQL

[Programming with Mosh MySQL Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA): This video taught me some tricks with MySQL syntax, especially with JOIN

[Inquirer documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4#installation): Obviously a good resource for understanding how to use inquirer package

Xpert Learning Assistant helped me to understand how to pass data from a function within a class into a property within that same class.
